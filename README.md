## Announcement
I have received some requests for accessing our code. I am sorry that we need some time to get everything ready since this repository is now supported by Zhanghan Ke alone. Our plans in the next few months are:
- We will publish an online image/video matting demo along with the pre-trained model **in these two weeks (approximately Dec. 7, 2020 to Dec. 18, 2020)**.
- We then plan to release the code of supervised training and unsupervised SOC in Jan. 2021.
- We finally plan to open source the PPM-100 validation benchmark in Feb. 2021.

We look forward to your continued attention to this project. Thanks.

## Video Matting Demo 
We provide two real-time portrait video matting demos based on WebCam.   
If you have an Ubuntu system, we recommend you to try the [offline demo](demo/video_matting) to get a higher *fps*. Otherwise, you can access the [online Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pt3KDSc2q7WxFvekCnCLD8P0gBEbxm6J?usp=sharing).


## Image Matting Demo
We provide an [online Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GANpbKT06aEFiW-Ssx0DQnnEADcXwQG6?usp=sharing) for portrait image matting.  
It allows you to upload portrait images and predict/visualize/download the alpha mattes.

## TO DO
- Release training code (scheduled in **Jan. 2021**)
- Release PPM-100 validation benchmark (scheduled in **Feb. 2021**)
